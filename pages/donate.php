<h1>Why Donate?</h1>
<p>KanjiBox is literally hundreds – probably thousands – hours of work.</p>

<p>Mostly: it is a labour of love (and the occasional donation-funded gin&amp;tonic).</p>

<p>However, with its growing popularity, the application has been putting severe strain on my servers: already forcing me to upgrade to a costly dedicated server solution in order to appease my company, likely requiring another upgrade soon.</p>
<p>I am still looking into ways to deal with the increased cost without having to restrict use of the application... Hopefully it will all work out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, a donation can't hurt.</p>
